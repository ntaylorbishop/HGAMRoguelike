How to Play:

Use arrow keys to move.
Click potions to use them, items to equip them.
Right-click items in equipment to remove them. 
Right-click items in inventory to destroy them.

There is a shop, stairs to the next level, and a cave to the boss room on every level.

Feature implemented:

There are now boss rooms on every level. These are self-contained rooms with one monster that stays still, and attacks when you attack. 
They drop multiple items when killed, and one legendary picked from the pool. The bosses are randomly picked from the table every time a level is generated.
